At the core of this toolbox are **models** and **schedulers**. While the `DiffusionPipeline` bundles these components together for convenience, you can also unbundle the pipeline and use the models and schedulers separately to create new diffusion systems.\n","\n","# Understanding Diffusion\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Diffusion Models: A Deep Dive\n","\n","Diffusion models are an exciting advancement in the field of generative models. The high-level idea is simple yet powerful: these models take images that are blurred with noise and learn to denoise them, resulting in clear images. During training, the model sees images with varying levels of noise, and at inference time, it starts with pure noise and iteratively generates an image that looks like it came from the training data.\n","\n","### The Key Insight: Iterative Refinement\n","\n","So, what makes diffusion models so effective? Unlike previous techniques like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which generate images in a single pass, diffusion models create images through many steps. This iterative process allows the model to refine and correct its output gradually, leading to high-quality image generation. To see this in action, let's explore an example using the Hugging Face diffusers library.\n","\n","### Loading a Pre-Trained Diffusion Model\n","\n","We'll use the `DDPMPipeline` from the Hugging Face diffusers library to load a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, we'll use the `ddpm-celebahq-256` model, which was trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset—a collection of high-quality celebrity images. This model will generate images resembling those in the dataset, starting from pure noise.\n","\n","In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use models and schedulers to assemble a diffusion system for inference. We'll start with a basic pipeline and then progress to the more complex Stable Diffusion pipeline.\n","\n","## Deconstruct a Basic Pipeline\n","\n","A pipeline is a quick and easy way to run a model for inference, requiring no more than four lines of code to generate an image:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e7be2346-9232-4b82-84d5-c090f26c61b4","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"e7be2346-9232-4b82-84d5-c090f26c61b4"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","from diffusers import DDPMPipeline\n","\n","ddpm = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained(\"google/ddpm-celebahq-256\").to(\"cuda\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bf90aa48-4ccd-4794-8756-081ce43e0795","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"bf90aa48-4ccd-4794-8756-081ce43e0795"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Generate a celebrity face\n","image = ddpm(num_inference_steps=30).images[0]\n","image"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bbcd03f4-0b01-410e-a808-57550571fe6c","metadata":{"id":"bbcd03f4-0b01-410e-a808-57550571fe6c"},"source":["This generates an image of a fake celebrity using the `DDPMPipeline`.

The pipeline denoises an image by taking random noise the size of the desired output and passing it through the model several times.
