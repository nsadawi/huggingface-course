You can ensure you are in the home directory by typing:\n","     ```bash\n","     cd ~\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Navigate to the `.cache` Directory:**\n","   - The `.cache` directory is a hidden directory in your home folder. You can navigate to it using:\n","     ```bash\n","     cd .cache\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **List Contents of the `.cache` Directory:**\n","   - To see the contents of the `.cache` directory, you can use the `ls` command:\n","     ```bash\n","     ls\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **Navigate to the `huggingface/hub` Directory:**\n","   - Now, navigate to the `huggingface/hub` directory:\n","     ```bash\n","     cd huggingface/hub\n","     ```\n","\n","6. **List Contents of the `hub` Directory:**\n","   - To see the contents of the `hub` directory, use the `ls` command again:\n","     ```bash\n","     ls\n","     ```\n","\n","7. **Find the Specific Cached Model Directory:**\n","   - Look for the directory you want to delete, in this example `models--stabilityai--stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt`. You can verify its presence by listing the contents:\n","     ```bash\n","     ls\n","     ```\n","\n","8. **Delete the Specific Cached Model Directory:**\n","   - Once you have confirmed the directory name, you can delete it using the `rm` command with the `-r` (recursive) flag. Be very careful with this command, as it will permanently delete the directory and its contents.\n","     ```bash\n","     rm -r models--stabilityai--stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt/\n","     ```\n","\n","### Example Commands Summary:\n","```bash\n","cd ~\n","cd .cache\n","cd huggingface/hub\n","ls\n","rm -r models--stabilityai--stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt/\n","```\n","\n","### Additional Tips:\n","- **Use Tab Completion:** While typing directory names, you can press the `Tab` key to autocomplete the names, which can help avoid typos.\n","- **Confirm Before Deleting:** If you're not sure about deleting a directory, you can list its contents with `ls` to confirm what it contains.\n","- **Backup Important Data:** Make sure you don't need any data from the directory you're deleting, as this operation is irreversible.\n","\n","Following these steps should help you navigate to the `~/.cache` directory, locate the `huggingface/hub` subdirectories, and delete a specific cached model directory using the command line."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"95c9e10d-a8a3-4932-abeb-adb293e11a7d","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"95c9e10d-a8a3-4932-abeb-adb293e11a7d"},"source":["### Release CUDA Memory"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"314e32f0-5c04-402d-a295-2e662bd637bf","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"314e32f0-5c04-402d-a295-2e662bd637bf"},"outputs":[],"source":["!nvidia-smi"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8a37a00c-1ab6-43c7-8d1c-329887b29523","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"8a37a00c-1ab6-43c7-8d1c-329887b29523"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","\n","torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"54da43ef-e159-4a34-8838-0118a01dcb64","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"54da43ef-e159-4a34-8838-0118a01dcb64"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","from diffusers import I2VGenXLPipeline\n","from diffusers.utils import load_image, export_to_gif, export_to_video"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"76da6ab6-e490-4284-95b2-ffaeb761f5db","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"76da6ab6-e490-4284-95b2-ffaeb761f5db"},"outputs":[],"source":["repo_id = \"ali-vilab/i2vgen-xl\"\n","pipeline = I2VGenXLPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant=\"fp16\")\n","# moves parts of the model between CPU and GPU automatically during inference to reduce GPU memory usage.\n","pipeline.enable_model_cpu_offload()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8c808354-ee71-4895-a0dc-e8ca04606782","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"8c808354-ee71-4895-a0dc-e8ca04606782"},"outputs":[],"source":["image_url = \"astronaut.png\"\n","image = load_image(image_url).convert(\"RGB\")\n","prompt = \"person jumping straight up\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"94728897-0ad0-4a80-997e-bce48e7bfba4","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"94728897-0ad0-4a80-997e-bce48e7bfba4"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set up a generator with a manual seed for reproducibility purposes\n","generator = torch.manual_seed(8888)\n","frames = pipeline(\n","    prompt=prompt,\n","    image=image,\n","    generator=generator\n",").frames[0]\n","\n","print(export_to_gif(frames))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0347db55-81bc-4bbb-85a5-d2ab14f41b23","metadata":{"id":"0347db55-81bc-4bbb-85a5-d2ab14f41b23"},"outputs":[],"source":["!nvidia-smi -L"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1bba796d-2a34-4355-b552-8762c60f6a2f","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"1bba796d-2a34-4355-b552-8762c60f6a2f"},"outputs":[],"source":["len(frames)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5dd594c0-3714-424e-adcd-32254d627aeb","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"5dd594c0-3714-424e-adcd-32254d627aeb"},"outputs":[],"source":["export_to_video(frames,'person_jump.mp4',fps=8)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"19d289ba-c9cd-43f2-96b0-af4848777e4c","metadata":{"id":"19d289ba-c9cd-43f2-96b0-af4848777e4c"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"machine_shape":"hm","gpuType":"A100"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
